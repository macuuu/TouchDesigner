        <div class="about-section">
            <p>I'm Level designer from Wrocław, creating mobile game experiences that are fun, intuitive, and optimized for short but meaningful play sessions. I enjoy shaping logical gameplay puzzles that feels smooth at first touch, yet deep enough to keep players coming back. My design approach is inspired by the clever simplicity of classic puzzle games, the endless worlds shaped by dynamic gameplay systems, and the way modern free-to-play titles keep players engaged without losing balance. I aim to create levels that not only challenge, but also reward players with a clear sense of progress and discovery. Thanks for the reading.</p>
